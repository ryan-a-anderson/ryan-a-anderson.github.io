I am a 3rd year PhD student at the Department of Statistics & Data Science at UCLA working with Guido Montufar on the mathematics of deep learning.

Recent News:
- I attended the wonderful workshop given by IPAM at UCLA last week, [Theory and Practice of Deep Learning](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/workshop-ii-theory-and-practice-of-deep-learning/?tab=overview).
- I attended workshops as part of the IMSI's long program ["Algebraic Statistics and Our Changing World"](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/algebraic-statistics-and-our-changing-world/) at the University of Chicago.
- I was accepted to be part of [the G-RIPS program given by the IPAM](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/graduate-level-research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-g-rips-sendai-2023/), an NSF institute at UCLA. G-RIPS took place at the Zuse Institute Berlin, located at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. My work with [Stefan Zachow's group](https://www.zib.de/members/zachow) and an industry sponsor, [1000Shapes GmbH](https://1000shapes.com/en/), concerned properties of statistical shape models and new approaches via neural networks including the variational autoencoder architecture introduced by [Tamaz Amiranashvili](https://www.dqbm.uzh.ch/en/research/menze/team/team-tamaz.html).
