# Unsolicited Guidance for the Day

Advisory guidance is max 2 beers per bar unless it's really fun! Especially early on. Not only is this day not a sprint, it's no mere marathon – this is the Pheidippides running to announce the victory at Marathon of beer drinking events.

As Deng advised, 韬光养晦 (bide your time, hide your strength), for the marquee hours at Skinny Dennis and Radegast!
