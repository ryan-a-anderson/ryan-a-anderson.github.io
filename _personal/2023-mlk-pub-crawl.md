# Overview

When in May 1754 an unremarkable cadre of well-off Virginians conducted a raiding mission under the leadership of the 22-year-old George Washington into the Alleghenies, determined to unshackle the trading economy of the region from the French manacles which bound it, the world could not have foreseen that within six years' time the British would wrest away all Quebec at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham; they could not have envisioned Clive conquering Bengal at Plassey; could not have known mother Austria had reached the zenith of her importance in world affairs.

Here we sit then, removed at the same distance as those mottle-eyed eighteenth century Europeans from the first serendipitous celebration of the RAWMLKPCE, with no smaller a set of surprises to contend with in the evolution of our own lives and those of the world around us.

In the course of the PCE's life, a global pandemic came by; the whole American government changed over; Britain lost a queen, gained a sausage-fingered king, and ate through PMs like a bag of crisps; Tesla gained a trillion dollars in market value and lost most of it again; the Nationals won a World Series; pants got big for both genders; *Coda* somehow won Best Picture; Papa John himself was defenestrated and went mad.

Amid the change we are comforted by the endurance of our one mission: to enjoy the splendor of urban life and rebel against the calamities of January equipped with beers, slushies, seltzers, and whichever other arms we may find for ourselves *en terre*.

Put another way: "6 God prayin hands like I'm a religious man..."

# Unsolicited Guidance for the Day

Advisory guidance is max 2 beers per bar unless it's really fun! Especially early on. Not only is this day not a sprint, it's no mere marathon – this is the Pheidippides running to announce the victory at Marathon of beer drinking events.

Here's what happens when you fail to plan (you plan to fail):

As Deng advised, 韬光养晦 (bide your time, hide your strength), for the marquee hours at Skinny Dennis and Radegast!
