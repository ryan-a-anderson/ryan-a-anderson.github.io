Reinforcement learning is a paradigm of statistical learning which is distinguished from supervised and unsupervised learning. 
In RL, an agent interacts with an unknown environment and aims to maximize the total rewards it obtains from interacting with the environment.

Note that in this note I will use $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$ for math mode.
