## Lecture 3/31: Measure and Integration on the Reals
We construct a chain of concepts in real analysis, beginning with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathbb{B}$ which is the $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}^n$ generated by all open sets.

Following that we have the Lebesgue measure, $m: \mathbb{B} \to [0,+\infty]$, which has lovely properties like countable additivity.

That leads naturally to the Lebesgue integral on $\mathbb{R}^n$ which we consider as a function $S: L^1(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathbb{C}$, where $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is the set of Lebesgue measurable functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$.

Note that $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is a very permissive class of functions. Contained within it is the set $C_c(\mathbb{R}^d)$, which consists of all continuous functions with compact support
